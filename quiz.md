## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
-SOA is an architectural style that structures software as a collection of loosely coupled services. These services communicate with each other to achieve specific business functionalities, and they can be reused and orchestrated to create complex applications.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- Loose Coupling: Services are independent and can operate without knowing the details of each other.
Reusability: Services are designed to be reusable in different contexts and applications.
Interoperability: Services can be implemented in different technologies and can communicate seamlessly.
Discoverability: Services are discoverable through a directory or registry.
Composability: Services can be combined to create new applications
3. Define Microservices.
- Microservices is an architectural approach where an application is developed as a collection of small, independent services, each focused on a specific business capability. These services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently based on demand.
Flexibility: Different microservices can be developed using different technologies.
Fault Isolation: If one microservice fails, it doesn't necessarily affect the entire application.
Continuous Deployment: Enables frequent and independent deployment of services.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-Similarities include loose coupling and the use of services, but microservices are smaller, independently deployable units, whereas SOA typically involves larger, more monolithic services.

6. Define Web Services.
-Web services are software components designed to communicate over a network. They are based on standard protocols like HTTP and XML, allowing different applications to interact with each other.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
-Interoperability: Web services enable communication between applications built on different platforms and technologies.
Loose Coupling: Services are loosely coupled, allowing changes in one service without affecting others.
Standardized Communication: Web services use standard protocols, making integration easier.
	
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
- Platform Independence: Can be implemented on any platform.
Interoperability: Can communicate across different technologies.
Loose Coupling: Components are independent of each other.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
- Service Provider: Develops and publishes the web service.
Service Requestor: Consumes the web service by sending requests.
Service Registry: Stores and provides information about available services.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
- XML (eXtensible Markup Language): Used for data representation.
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): Protocol for message format in web services.
WSDL (Web Services Description Language): Describes the functionality offered by a web service.
UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration): Directory for storing information about web services.
